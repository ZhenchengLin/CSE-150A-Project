# **Bayesian Network AI Agent for Predicting Game Popularity & Pricing**  

## **Overview**  
This project implements a **Bayesian Network AI Agent** to analyze and predict key aspects of a **new game's success** based on historical data. The model is trained on **Steam game data** and leverages **probabilistic inference** to predict:  

- **Game Popularity** (Average & Median Playtime)  
- **Optimal Pricing**  
- **Estimated Number of Owners**  

The AI agent follows a **probabilistic approach** using **Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs)** and **Bayesian Inference** to model relationships between **developers, publishers, pricing, playtime, and ownership trends**.  

---

## **Dataset**  
The dataset is sourced from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FronkonGames/steam-games-dataset) and contains information on over **83,000+** Steam games, including:  
✅ **Game Metadata** – Developer, Publisher 
✅ **Market Data** – Price, Owners, Revenue  
✅ **Engagement Metrics** – Average & Median Playtime
✅ **User Reviews** – Positive and Negative Ratings  

---

## **Modeling Approach**  

### **1️⃣ Bayesian Network Structure**
The model is structured as a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**:  

1. **Developers & Publishers** → Predict **Playtime (Popularity)**  
2. **Playtime (Popularity)** → Predict **Price**  
3. **Price** → Predict **Estimated Owners (Sales)**  
4. **Estimated Owners + Price** → Predict **Revenue**  

### **2️⃣ Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs)**  
We compute CPTs for key variables:  

| Parent Variables | Target Variable | Function |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Developers, Publishers | Average Playtime Forever, Median Playtime Forever | `Get_CPT_Avg_Median()` |
| Average Playtime, Median Playtime | Price | `Get_CPT_Price()` |
| Price | Estimated Owners | `Get_CPT_Estimated_Owners()` |

---

## **Implementation Details**

### **🔹 Data Preprocessing & Normalization**  
To simplify numerical features, we manually **bin** continuous values into **three categories (0,1,2):**  

| Feature | Bin 0 (Low) | Bin 1 (Medium) | Bin 2 (High) |
|---------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Average Playtime Forever** | 0 - 5 mins | 5 - 20,000 mins | 20,000+ mins |
| **Median Playtime Forever** | 0 - 10 mins | 10 - 40,000 mins | 40,000+ mins |
| **Estimated Owners** | 0 - 20,000 | 20,000 - 1,000,000 | 1,000,000+ |
| **Price** | $0 - $5 | $5 - $40 | $40+ |
| **Positive Ratio** | 0% - 50% | 50% - 80% | 80%+ |
| **Negative Ratio** | 0% - 50% | 50% - 80% | 80%+ |

**Function:** `Clean_Normalize()`  

---

### **🔹 AI Agent with Bayesian Inference**  
The AI agent performs **probabilistic queries** to predict the **most likely outcome** for a new game.  

**Example:**  
💡 *Predicting the price of the next game by Valve*  
```python
# Initialize the Bayesian Model
bayesian_model = BayesianNetworkModel(percent=0.8)

# Predict the most probable price category for the next Valve game
developer_name = "Valve"
publisher_name = "Valve"

predicted_price = bayesian_model.get_probability(developer_name, publisher_name)
print(f"Predicted price category: {predicted_price}")
```
➡️ **Output:** `"Most probable price category: 1 (Medium, $5 - $40)"`

---

## **Functions Implemented**

### **1️⃣ Conditional Probability Estimation**
```python
def Get_CPT_Avg_Median(self):
def Get_CPT_Price(self):
def Get_CPT_Estimated_Owners(self):
```
📌 Computes **normalized probability tables** based on past data.

---

### **2️⃣ Querying the Model**
```python
def get_probability(self, Developers, Publishers):
```
📌 Returns **most probable playtime, price, and estimated owners** for a new game.

---

### **3️⃣ Interpreting Binned Values**
```python
def get_range_description(column_name, bin_value):
```
📌 Converts **0,1,2** bins into **human-readable ranges.**

Example:
```python
print(get_range_description("Price", 2))  # Output: "$40+"
```

---

### **4️⃣ Finding the Most Likely Category**
```python
def get_most_probable_category(distribution):
```
📌 Given a **list of probabilities**, returns the **most likely outcome**.

Example:
```python
prob_list = [0.8, 0.1, 0.1]
print(get_most_probable_category(prob_list))  # Output: 0 (Low)
```

## **Evaluation & Next Steps**

### ✅ **Current Achievements**
🔹 **Fully implemented Bayesian Network**  
🔹 **CPTs computed & stored efficiently**  
🔹 **Model can predict price, playtime, and ownership trends**  
🔹 **Interpretable binning strategy applied to numerical values**  

### 🔜 **Future Improvements**
🔹 **Optimize inference speed** (Currently queries are direct CPT lookups)  
🔹 **Add online learning** (Update CPTs dynamically with new games)  
🔹 **Incorporate deep learning** (Use Bayesian Neural Networks)  

---

## **How to Run**
### **🔹 Step 1: Install Requirements**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

### **🔹 Step 2: Run the Model**
```python
from bayesian_model import BayesianNetworkModel

# Initialize model
model = BayesianNetworkModel(percent=0.8)

# Predict next Valve game price
print(model.get_probability("Valve", "Valve"))
```

---

## **Conclusion**
This Bayesian Network AI Agent provides a **probabilistic framework** for predicting **game popularity, pricing, and ownership trends** based on historical Steam data. It helps **game developers and analysts** make **data-driven pricing decisions** and optimize **marketing strategies**.
